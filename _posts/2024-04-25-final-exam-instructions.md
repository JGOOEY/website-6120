The exam code `exam_class.py` should now be shared with your Northeastern University account. (Ensure that you are logged into Colab with your University account.) 

* Find the `exam_class.py` in Google Drive, "Shared with me". 
<p align="center">
<img src="http://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/spring2024/final/shared-file.png" width="600"/>
</p>

* Create a **shortcut** to the shared file. Do _not_ copy the file. Only edit this file.

* Mount Google Drive in your Colab. You can refresh the file folder view if it doesn't appear.

* Copy the path location of the shortcut to the `filepath` variable below with the quotes. (So "\<path-to-shortcut\>/exam_class.py"). You can now use this path to execute changes in your file whenever you have edited `exam_class.py` with the code: `execfile(filepath)`. You will modify and change `exam_class.py`, and we will autograde it.
