The project [submission site](http://gradescope.com) is now open for uploading your report, slides, and code repository. **Please add your presentation link to** [the lecture slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T8E2ul2sH5b380N1LFXxJ2sn47nMqbGaJkph4jcIvDo/edit#slide=id.g2a04ebc454c_0_0).

For the submission itself, feel free to use the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cH9TaR2MHpiYLMkeZjyZ7e78E00jE66zNv6xxu6M72E) and [document templates](https://www.overleaf.com/project/64e2ee609dd6f4b743ea664e), all available at [the project information page](../../presentation-and-project/), which has rubrics and submission instructions.

The final exam format will be a Colab, much like that in your labs, where you'll see many <YOUR-CODE-HERE> blocks. It will be project based, and cover elements of (Py)Spark, Data Preprocessing, and Machine Learning. You can use the internet to look up libraries. You cannot use ChatGPT or Bard.
