Policy on AI Systems: Use of AI tools, LLM, etc., is allowed on homeworks, labs, and projects, but discouraged to ensure proper learning of core competencies (i.e., they should not be used as a crutch.) These can be used as study aids but not as direct submissions without vetting, understanding, or thought. Enforcement on homeworks, labs, and projects will be conducted by teaching assistant. Enforcement on big ticket items (i.e., exams) will be conducted by instructor and teaching assistant, where instructions explicitly prohibit the use of LLMs.
