For the remainder of the semester, our lectures will be in San Jose, Room 301. 

This week, we'll be learning about market basket analysis, which is a rule-based approach to mining transactional data. The main topics this week will be to learn about frequent itemsets and association rules. Market basket analysis is a pivotol techniques used by retailers to uncover associations between items. The hypothesis is that combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions data form relationships that we can exploit.
