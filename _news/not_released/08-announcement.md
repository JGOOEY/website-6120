Midterms are graded and will be returned next week (November 7). The grade histogram appears bimodal. The statisics are as follows:

* Average score over all enrolled students = 69.2
* Median score over all enrolled students = 72.0
* Standard deviation is around 12 points

The distribution is shown below.

Breaking down the performance, the average scoring per question provides the following insights:

* Students most understood how to do PySpark joins
* Students least understood the intuition behind k-means.

On key concepts,

* Map reduce understanding remains middling
* Application of Bayesian Theory could be improved, but general concept understanding is apparent.

Average score by question is shown below.
