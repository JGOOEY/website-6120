You only need to do questions 1 and 2 in homework five, and You do *not* need to do question 3 this week. [See the Teams thread](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:6e5fd5a350344874bd210ee09a85d32a@thread.tacv2/1708364322727?tenantId=a8eec281-aaa3-4dae-ac9b-9a398b9215e7&groupId=6598288e-4482-4e4f-bbd9-7eda41a84758&parentMessageId=1708364322727&teamName=CS6220%20Data%20Mining%20Techniques%20-%20Spring%202024&channelName=Assignment%205&createdTime=1708364322727). Of the three questions in [homework 5](../../homework-5/), questions 1 and 2 are about Bayes Theorem, which are designed to aid in studying for the exam. We will be moving Q3 to the following homework.

### Midterm Preparation

The midterm exam will consist of ten questions, and students will have the entire three hours and twenty minutes to complete it. All formulas will be provided; no cheatsheets, computers, or electronic devices are allowed. (You can bring your phones, just donâ€™t use them during the exam.) We will provide scratch paper. The breakdown of these questions are:

* Map Reduce Questions (30%)
* Principle Component Analysis (10%)
* Maximum Likelihood Questions (10%)
* Unsupervised Machine Learning Questions (10%)
* Multi-Part Frequent Itemsets and Association Rules Questions (20%)
* Fresh Content Bayesian Rules Questions (20%)

The midterm is close book without any notes. I will provide some information on the board so that memorization of formulas is unnecessary. Among the information that I anticipate as helpful, here are some that might help:

* Commonly used map-reduce functions: `map`, `reduceByKey`, and `filter`
* Some helpful derivatives and math properties: `log`, `exponent`, `product`
* Probabilistic rules: conditional probability, total probability, and Bayes rule

I would suggest that you practice these so that you needn't look up at the board so frequently.
