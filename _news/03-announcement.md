We will meet in Room 301. Lecture notes for Week 1 and Homework 1 are released. My office hours are updated to Tuesday 8:30pm-9:30pm.

We'll have two aliases this semester:

* **Our class e-mail** is [cs6220-class@ccs.neu.edu](mailto:cs6220-class.ccs.neu.edu). This will e-mail the enrolled students in CS6220 as they appear on Canvas and Khoury enrollment.

* **Our staff e-mail** is [cs6220-staff@ccs.neu.edu](mailto:cs6220-staff.ccs.neu.edu). This will e-mail instructor and teaching assistant as they appear on Canvas and Khoury enrollment.
