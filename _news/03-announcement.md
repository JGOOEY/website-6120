Instruction will be *in-classroom*, but I'll make the best effort to be available online for anyone who has questions outside of lectures. 

* Please note that our lectures will now occur in Room 912/913 and **not** Room 1010.

* Our teams channel is now active.

* Our class e-mail is [cs6220-class@ccs.neu.edu](mailto:cs6220-class.ccs.neu.edu). This will e-mail the enrolled students in CS6220 as they appear on Canvas and Khoury enrollment.

* Our staff e-mail is [cs6220-staff@ccs.neu.edu](mailto:cs6220-staff.ccs.neu.edu). This will e-mail instructor and teaching assistant as they appear on Canvas and Khoury enrollment. 

Looking forward to the semester. Homework 1 is out and released as are the lecture notes.
