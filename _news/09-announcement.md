Starting November 14, we'll be moving to Room 902 on the ninth floor. Please attend next Tuesday at 6pm in this new room. We'll post some reminder signage for those of you who miss this announcement on Teams and via e-mail.

[Homework 6]({{ site.baseurl }}/homeworks/assignment-6) on writing code for algorithmic evaluation has been assigned and is due next week (11/14/2023). [Homework 7]({{ site.baseurl }}/homeworks/assignment-7) has *also* been assigned this week, but it will be due the following week (11/21/2023).

Please start looking for some interesting datasets to do data mining on for your project. I have a [proposal template]({{ site.baseurl }}/project-proposal/). Feel free to propose something (not required) with the template proposal.
