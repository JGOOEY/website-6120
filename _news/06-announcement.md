Spring Break starts on March 4-8, so there will not be lecture on March 7. Similarly, Karl will be traveling on March 11-15, and there will be no lecture on March 14. Midterm Grades will be posted during this time. Homework 5 will still be due on February 22, the week before the midterm. Homework 6 will be issued on February 22, but it will not be due until Week 10, March 21, giving you *four weeks* to complete it. You won't need that much time.
