### Additional Midterm Preparation

[Midterm preparation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vh_IrsHOMkrAUxKSyfDurK6e4pAyKn_M) were linked in [last week's (2/22) lecture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DSwQrXf06ksWLmC7gHZBPcos4ERCP9fM). 

In Class, there was a request to solve the PySpark k-Means problem. I would encourage you **to not look at the following code**, but in case you are absolutely blocked and cannot move forward, please peruse: [PySpark - Map/Reduce k-Means](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:0wiew4w59eyTcq-GiBIzqyiNW4QBMyUGj1CfgirpdQw1@thread.tacv2/1708704491771?tenantId=a8eec281-aaa3-4dae-ac9b-9a398b9215e7&groupId=6598288e-4482-4e4f-bbd9-7eda41a84758&parentMessageId=1708704491771&teamName=CS6220%20Data%20Mining%20Techniques%20-%20Spring%202024&channelName=General&createdTime=1708704491771).

### Open AI's SORA can now create videos

**Prompt:**

A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, and black boots, and carries a black purse. She wears sunglasses and red lipstick. She walks confidently and casually. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror effect of the colorful lights. Many pedestrians walk about.
