Hey there! I'm Amogha Sekhar, Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Etsy. My focus revolves around refining our recommendation engine to ensure top-notch user experiences through modeling and product delivery. Prior to Etsy, I spent two and a half years at Twitter (now X) on the Home Timeline Ranking and Relevance team, where I played a vital role in optimizing various components of our recommendation system from candidate generation, light and heavy ranker, feature engineering, to post-ranking heuristics. Twitter was my first full-time gig after graduating from UC San Diego with a Master's in Computer Science, specializing in AI. Additionally, I have prior internship experiences at Intuit, where I secured a patent for OCR technology, and also at Accenture and Microsoft. I'm driven by a passion for leveraging technology to make a positive and meaningful impact in this world. I am happy to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amogha-sekhar/) to chat further!

Amogha will be speaking on a panel during Khoury College's Industry Panel and Networking event, April 10, 2024, at 4pm, Northeastern Silicon Valley.
