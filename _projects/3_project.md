<p>Hi! I'm Joy (Hsin Yu) Guo, and I'm thrilled to be your CS6120 Teaching Assistant for the semester. Here, you can write your biography. For example, I am a X year graduate student in Y college. My advisor is F and I'm focusing on E applied to G. Previously, I studied at Z as an undergraduate at the University of L at M, located in N, majoring in A. I've held internships and roles at company B and C, and my research interests are D. My objectives in my career are to be the most awesome natural language processing scientist in the world, and I know that I will get the Nobel prize for it.

### A Little More About Myself

Tell use a bit more about yourself! What's your interests? If you need more images, you can add them to the folder:

```
assets/img/<IMAGE.png>
```

You will need to refer to it in this markdown code with relative links, in this case you would say:

```
![Your Image](../../assets/img/<IMAGE.png>)
```

There's an example above with the relative link.
