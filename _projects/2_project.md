### From the Unknown to Discovery

My academic path has been unconventional, taking me through Physics, Electrical Engineering, Finance, and Math before I made a shift to Computer Science. Along the way, Iâ€™ve embraced the uncertainty of the future, trusting that the connections between these experiences will reveal themselves in time. Each step has been part of a broader process of **mining and self-discovery**, where meaning is forged through reflection and exploration.
