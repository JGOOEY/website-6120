This course in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a mix of first principles and heavy doses of software engineering. The key objectives two-fold: (1) to teach the fundamental concepts of NLP and (2) to provide extensive and practical hands-on modeling experience. Our language modeling curriculum will cover a variety of use cases, including but not limited to sentiment analysis, question / answer, summarization, translation, and more. The core topics to be covered in this course include topic models, word/sentence embedding models, deep attention models, and large language models (LLMs). 

There is a heavy project component to this course, where students will build and serve applications that leverage modern capabilities, all of which can be attained from open source (even the LLMs, like Facebook's Llama 3.) Students will attain foundational knowledge, and subsequently be able to scale their processing (both training and inference) with cloud computing, as this course takes advantage of cloud computing with generous grants from Google through Google Cloud Compute (GCP). 

By the end of this class, students will have first-hand knowledge and be able to replicate (if not contribute to) any modern NLP approaches that companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta might invent. They will be able to read most of the technical papers that advance this technology. But perhaps most importantly, they will have a fun and rewarding experience processing natural language and understanding the machine learning that goes into it.
