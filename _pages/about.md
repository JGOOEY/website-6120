The key objectives of this course are two-fold: (1) to teach the fundamental concepts of data mining and (2) to provide extensive hands-on experience in applying the concepts to real-world applications. The core topics to be covered in this course include classification, clustering, association analysis, and anomaly/novelty detection. This course consists of about 13 weeks of lecture, followed by 1 week of project presentations by students who will be responsible for developing and/or applying data mining techniques to applications such as intrusion detection, Web usage analysis, financial data analysis, text mining, bioinformatics, systems management, Earth Science, and other scientific and engineering areas. At the end of this course, students are expected to possess the fundamental skills needed to conduct their own research in data mining or to apply data mining techniques to production level engineering infrastructure.
