## Keynote Reading Schedule

Keynote papers are required reading that underly the fundamentals of modern natural language processing theory and practice. Each week, students should sign up for a paper. [Please do so here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xVrHl8MgkrXhJnYbW5QJP4wEPROlPaSz8xGR1JDtIfY). Updates (it might take a few minutes) on the current schedule can be viewed here:

### Reading Group Schedule

For each of the papers, during the following week, there will be a reading group _discussion_, which the lead will facilitate. Even though there are leads and co-leads, everyone is expected to contribute in the conversation. Additionally, as there are no lecture notes for the discussion, a scribe will record salient points from the discussion; where these can be posted weekly.


* **Lead**: Facilitator and discussion generator
* **Discussion**: Everyone should have read the paper for an interesting discussion
* **Paper Summary** An summary of the paper (one-pager), providing an overview of the work
* **Scribe**: Notes taking on interesting topics to share out to other students

### Templates and LaTeX

Prepare the notes into a latex document (including figures, if
appropriate) using this
<a href="scribe_notes/template.tex">latex template</a>.&nbsp; If you are new to latex, you can look at the
<a href="scribe_notes/0204.tex">raw latex</a>
that was used to
generate the scribe notes for lecture #1
(and here is a figure called
<a href="scribe_notes/generic-ml.pdf">generic-ml.pdf</a> 
that gets included by that file).&nbsp; Information about latex is available, 
for instance, <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">here</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">here</a>.&nbsp;

Once you have completed your notes, please add to the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xVrHl8MgkrXhJnYbW5QJP4wEPROlPaSz8xGR1JDtIfY). Request permissions with your **Northeastern University** account. Templates and instructions are taken from [here](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring19/cos511/scribeinfo.html).
